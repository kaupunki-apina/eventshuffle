# Eventshuffle

Application for easing the plannning of group events.


## Usage

**Note:** Prerequisite for running this program is that you have mongoDB up and running, as well as Node.js installed. Instructions on how to achieve this are abundant online, and thus, not included here.

Install required dependencies by running
```
npm install
```

Application is written according to ES6 standards as much as possible. Since some ES6 features are not yet supported by Node.js, the source must be transpiled.
```
npm run transpile
```

Run the server using
```
npm run runserver
```

That's it. You are all set!
